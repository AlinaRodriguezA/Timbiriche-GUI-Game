# TIMBIRICHE GUI GAME
This is a multiplayer board game based on strategy. The players take turns trying to complete the drawing of a square on the dotted sheet with their respective color, if theyâ€™re the ones to do it, they get a point. The one rule is that the sides of the squares that are drawn must not overlap with the sides of the squares that are already drawn.

It was developed on Java, and comes with a Graphic User Interface and multiple game modes (multiplayer and vs the computer, on easy, medium and hard levels).
